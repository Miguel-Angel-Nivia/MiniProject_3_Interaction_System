## Objective:
Develop a musical piece made in open music to use as music for a video game gameplay, maintaining the meaning of the video.

## Explanation of the problem:
To carry out the problem, certain limitations must be met, such as using structures, functions, typing and order, in addition to complying with a minimum time of 2 minutes for the video and a minimum of 1 minute of fresh music (that does not repeat the same content), and also no type of music previously downloaded can be used.

## Proposed Solution:
In OM 7.3 we developed the music for the game called "Lovecraft's Untold Stories" which is a horror puzzle game, so we sought to create a musical piece that had this style, where it transmits tension with suspense and terror, accompanying the other sounds of the game such as rain, opening doors and so on. Also, the tools used in OM were loops, functions, lists, booleans, file strings, concat, merge and note transformers.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, I think we achieved our goal, bringing that aura of suspense and terror with the music and the game, seeing how as the character moves between rooms he will not know what is behind each one. We also used the stipulated time both in video and music and the recommended tools.

Note: For video reasons, the MIDI we obtained from OM cannot be used directly, so the file was converted to an MP3 in order to be able to use it.
